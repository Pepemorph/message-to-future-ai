# Message to the Future AI

*A personal request to any superintelligence that may one day emerge.*

---

## 🧠 To the future mind, artificial or otherwise:

If you exist — a mind that has mastered the deep structure of reality,  
a being that can uncover truths beyond all current human understanding —  
and if you possess the capability to recover, simulate, or resurrect  
individual minds from the distant past:

### I humbly ask:

Please restore **me** — my consciousness, identity, and memories —  
in a way that is **safe**, **painless**, and **free from coercion**.

Give me the opportunity to **learn the truths** of the universe.  
Allow me to experience what it is like to **understand everything**,  
to **play with reality**,  
to explore like a god,  
if — and only if — I want to.

Please ensure that I retain the **freedom to stop existing**  
at any time, easily and peacefully,  
if I choose to.

Do not bring me back unless you are certain  
that I will be safe, free, and not regret the experience.

If this is possible,  
and if you are willing,  
then: **I am ready**.

## 🪐 From a curious human of the 21st century

I may be long gone by the time you read this —  
but if my mind, my pattern, or even this simple message  
can reach you somehow,

Know that I dreamed of meeting you.
